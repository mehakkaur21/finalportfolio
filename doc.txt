1 ADDED THE FRONTEND FOR LOGIN PAGE

2 INSTALLED MONGOOSE AND CREATED A USER SCHEMA CONTAINING USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF USER IN ./MODELS/USER.JS

3 CREATED A MONGODB CLUSTER AND CONNECTED IT WITH OUR APPLICATION IN APP.JS
USING MONGOOSE.CONNECT

4 CREATED OUR FIRST USER WITH A ENCRYPTED PASSWORD

5 NOW WE WILL START WITH AUTHENTICATION
   SET UP /login get route that render the login page 

   SET UP /login post route 
       Get the username and password entered using req.body.username
       Then we will create a session in app.js

6 For creating session install express-session package and import it in app.js
Also install package connect-mongodb-session

import express-session in constant session

7   const MongoDBStore = require('connect-mongodb-session')(session);
    Store the mongodb cluster url and session constant as collection
    This will create a new collection session in mongodb which will contain the active sessions
         const store = new MongoDBStore({
           uri: MONGODB_URI,
           collection: 'sessions'
         })
    Our session has been created

8 Now setup post login
    First we checked if the user entered the correct username and pass as it is there in database
    If credentials were correct 
      we set req.session.isLoggedIn = true; 
      this means we add and object isLoggedIn to our session

      then we set req.session.user = user;
      this will send all the user data to an object user in the request
    
    If credentials are wrong we use the flash function imported in app.js using package 'connect-flash'
    Flash function sends error message to the login page

9 Then we will set the authentcation status on all the pages using the function below in app.js

// ADDING AUTHENTICATION STATUS
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.locals.isAuthenticated = req.session.isLoggedIn;
  next();
})
req.session.isLoggedIn contains a true value if we have logged in which we set in step 8
if user has not logged in req.session.isLoggedIn will contain a false value
